## Module Breakdown

- **Lead Generation**: Uses Apollo.io to find high-quality leads
- **Google Sheets Manager**: Handles data storage and tracking
- **Social Outreach**: Manages X and Instagram interactions
- **Payment Processing**: Handles Stripe and Razorpay payments
- **Content Generation**: Creates and schedules social media content

## Data Storage

All data is stored in Google Sheets with the following structure:

1. **Leads Sheet**: Stores lead information
   - Name, company, location, contact details, social profiles

2. **Outreach Sheet**: Tracks all outreach activities
   - Messages sent, platforms used, follow-up counts, responses

3. **Deals Sheet**: Manages payment and deal information
   - Package details, pricing, payment status

## Customization

### Message Templates

Edit the message templates in `config.py` under `OutreachConfig`:

```python
INITIAL_DM_TEMPLATE = """
Hey {first_name}! I noticed you're {industry_context}. I help {target_type} automate sales & get more clients with AI. Want to see how?
"""
```

### Payment Packages

Edit the package definitions in `payment_processing.py`:

```python
packages = {
    "basic": {
        "name": "Basic AI Sales Automation",
        "description": "AI-powered lead generation and outreach automation",
        "price_usd": 2500,  # $2,500
        "price_inr": 40000,  # â‚¹40,000
    },
    # Add more packages as needed
}
```

### Content Templates

Add or modify content templates in `config.py` under `ContentConfig`:

```python
CONTENT_TEMPLATES = {
    "success_stories": [
        "How an agency saved 10+ hours/week with our AI automation system. #AIautomation #AgencyGrowth",
        # Add more templates
    ],
    # Add more categories
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **API Rate Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits for X, Instagram, and Apollo.io
2. **Message Personalization**: Customize message templates for higher response rates
3. **Content Quality**: Create varied and valuable content for social media
4. **Payment Testing**: Test payment flows in sandbox mode before going live
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Update credentials and tokens as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**: Check API credentials in `.env` file
2. **Rate Limiting**: Adjust delay parameters in `config.py`
3. **Instagram Blocks**: Use a proper delay between actions to avoid blocks
4. **Apollo.io Errors**: Verify query parameters in the lead generation module
